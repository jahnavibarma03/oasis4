        Mahatma Gandhi, fondly known as Gandhiji, was a beacon of truth,
        nonviolence, and selfless service. His life and teachings continue to inspire 
        and guide generations around the world. Let us pay tribute to this extraordinary soul:

    <p class="para1">
        In a world of turmoil, he stood for peace,<br/>
        A symbol of love that would never cease.<br/>
        Gandhiji, with his spinning wheel in hand,<br/>
        Showed us the power of principles to withstand.<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="para1">
        Nonviolence, his weapon of choice,<br/>
        He taught us to rise above anger's voice.<br/>
        Through marches and protests, he led the way,<br/>
        With truth as his armor, he'd never sway.<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="para1">
        Simple living and high thinking he preached,<br/>
        Inequality and injustice he vehemently breached.<br/>
        From Dandi to Quit India, he led the fight,<br/>
        For India's freedom, he shone so bright.<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="para1">
        His life was a testament to inner strength,<br/>
        A journey of self-discovery, at great length.<br/>
        With humility and determination as his guide,<br/>
        He transformed hearts and turned the tide.<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="para1">
        Gandhiji's legacy lives on today,<br/>
        In every heart that strives to find a way,<br/>
        To solve conflicts without shedding blood,<br/>
        And stand for justice, like he always stood.<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="para1"> 
        Let's remember the man who walked his talk,<br/>
        Whose legacy continues to forever stalk.<br/>
        In a world often torn by hate and strife,<br/>
        Gandhiji's message remains our guiding light.<br/>
